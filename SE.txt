Software Engineering :

It is a standard procedure in order to develop
a software

Life Cycle :

1.Planning (Requirement Analysis)
2.Analysis
3.design
4.code
5.test
6.deploy
7.Maintain

Models :

Classic waterfall model :

It follows sequential approach

Unified process model :

It is an incremental process model

Spiral model :

Risk handling model

Testing :

Software testing is a process, to evaluate
the functionality of a software application

Black Box Testing (closed testing):

Internal structure of the software is hidden

it is to test behaviour testing 


No prior knowledge of programming is
required 

It is least time consuming 


White Box testing :(clear box testing ):

Internal structure is known to the tester

it is to test logic part of software

prior knowledge of programming is
required 

It is most time consuming.

Examples :

Boundary value analysis

Equal class partitioning

Decision table 

examples :

A. Path Testing 
 
B. Loop Testing 
 
C. Condition testing
